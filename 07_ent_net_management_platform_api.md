# What Is an SDK?:
An SDK (software development kit) or devkit is a set of software development tools that developers can use to create software or applications for a certain platform, operating system, computer system, or device. An SDK typically contains a set of libraries, APIs, documentation, tools, sample code, and processes that make it easier for developers to integrate, develop, and extend the platform. An SDK is created for a specific programming language, and it is very common to have the same functionality exposed through SDKs in different programming languages.

As you will see in this chapter and throughout this book, where there is an API, there is usually also an SDK. Software developers can, of course, implement and spend time on developing code to interact with an API (for example, building their own Python classes and methods to authenticate, get data from the API, or create new objects in the API), or they can take advantage of the SDK, which makes all these objects already available.

A good SDK has these qualities:
- Is easy to use
- Is well documented
- Has value-added functionality
- Integrates well with other SDKs
- Has minimal impact on hardware resources

SDKs provide the following advantages:
- Quicker integration
- Faster and more efficient development
- Brand control
- Increased security
- Metrics

# Cisco Meraki: 
From a programmability perspective, the Meraki cloud platform provides several APIs:

- Captive Portal API extends the power of the built-in Meraki splash page functionality by providing complete control of the content and authentication process that a user interacts with when connecting to a Meraki wireless network. Meraki network administrators can completely customize the portal.
- Scanning API akes advantage of Meraki smart devices equipped with wireless and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) functionality to provide location analytics and report on user behavior. This can be especially useful in retail, healthcare, and enterprise environments, where business intelligence and information can be extracted about trends and user engagement and behavior. The Scanning API delivers data in real time and can be used to detect Wi-Fi and BLE devices and clients.
- MV Sense Camera API akes advantage of the powerful onboard processor and a unique architecture to run machine learning workloads at the edge. Through the MV Sense API, object detection, classification, and tracking are exposed and become available for application integration.
- Dashboard API provides endpoints and resources for configuration, management, and monitoring automation of the Meraki cloud platform. 
  - Provisioning new organizations, administrators, networks, devices, and more
  - Configuring networks at scale
  - Onboarding and decommissioning of clients
  - Building custom dashboards and applications
