# Software Development and Design

Programin is much more than just creating an some code and run it. Each and every software even the smallest one has some of the following steps while created.

1. Planning (requirement analysis): Identifying the use case that the software suposed to solve. 
2. Defining: analysing functional specification and defining what the software should do.
3. Desiging: turn the software specifications into a design specification.
4. Building: Vreating the software based on the specification. (If the previous stages are completed successfully, this stage is often considered the easy part.)
5. Testing: Testing application behaviour. Bug and defect search. Application works as expected?
6. Deployment: Software is put into production. After final acceptance this stage becomes the maintanance.

ISO/IEC 12207 is the international standard for software lifecycle processes, and there are numerous organizations around the globe that use it for certification of their software development efforts.

Most popular SDLC models:

- **Waterfall**
- **Lean**
- **Agile**
- Iterative model
- Spiral model
- V model
- Big Bang model
- Prototyping models

## Waterfall
Started back in the '50 when IT and softwares just started to kick in and a few people knew how to program. The constructing business process (in which every step along the way was dependent on the completion of the previous step in the process.) gave the idea to the Waterfall model and became the most populat SDLC approach.

**Waterfall is a serial** approach to software development that is divided into phases:

- Requirements/analysis: Software features and functionality needs are cataloged and assessed to determine the necessary capabilities of the software.
- Design: Software architecture is defined
- Coding: Coding the software based on the design
- Testing: The completed code is tested for quality and customer acceptance
- Maintenance: Bug fixes and patches are applied.
