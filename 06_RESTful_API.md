## RESTful API Fundamentals
An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions and procedures intended to be used as an interface for software components to communicate with each other. An API may be for a web app, an operating system, a database system, computer hardware, or any software library. A common example of an API is the Google Maps API, which lets you interface with Google Maps so that you can display maps in your application, query locations, and so on. 

### API Types

APIs can be broadly classified into three categories, based on the type of work that each one provides:
- **Service API:** In a service API, an application can call on another application to solve a particular problem. Usually these systems can exist independently. For example, in a payment system, an application can call the API to accept payments via credit cards. As another example, with a user-management system, an application can call an API to validate and authenticate users.

- **Information API:** An information API allows one application to ask another application for information. Information in this context can refer to data gathered over time, telemetry data, or a list of devices that are currently connected.

- **Hardware API:** Application developers use hardware APIs to gain access to the features of hardware devices. Usually these APIs encompass some kind of hardware or sensors, and an application can call this kind of API to get the GPS location or real-time sensor data such as temperature or humidity.
