## RESTful API Fundamentals
An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions and procedures intended to be used as an interface for software components to communicate with each other. An API may be for a web app, an operating system, a database system, computer hardware, or any software library. A common example of an API is the Google Maps API, which lets you interface with Google Maps so that you can display maps in your application, query locations, and so on.
